# MicrophoneLock
This is a simple, self contained, Windows 11 targeted .exe that allows Users to set microphone levels to a specified value between 0 and 100 - and keep it there!

Consider verifying with the included hash using the following in PowerShell: Get-FileHash "\path\to\MicrophoneLock.exe" -Algorithm SHA256

Users will likely be stopped by Windows SmartScreen on launch. To get around this, select "More information" when the warning appears and then click "Run anyway"
